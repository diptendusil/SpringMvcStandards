# Spring Mvc Coding Standards

The purpose of the [47 Degrees](http://47deg.com) Spring Coding Standards is to create a collaboration baseline; helpful for scenarios where many people are creating, modifying, and contributing to the same project. The end goal is unity, consistency, and the notion that a single entity worked on the project.

This document, expected to be followed by any developers at 47 Degrees, is a subset and complement to the [Java Coding Standards](../).

## 1. Configuration

Spring is the de facto IOC container used at *47 Degrees* for Java server side applications. 
Both XML and annotation based configurations are being used.
[XML configuration](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html) is favored for those services and beans that have not originally been annotated with either [@Component](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/api/org/springframework/stereotype/Component.html), [@Service](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/api/org/springframework/stereotype/Service.html), [@Controller](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/api/org/springframework/stereotype/Controller.html)... or that require certain depedencies that are easier to wire via xml.
[Annotations](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-annotation-config) are preffered for Services in local packages and default Service interface implementations for applications that use package scanning to wire and discover the application context.

## 2. Services

Spring services should always be implementations of a Service interface that hides the implementations details when being used in other services dependencies.
Consider the following requirements. 

* The application needs a UserService to manipulate User model beans. 
* The User service should hide any dependencies it has in other services or 3rd party technologies.
* The service implementation could be replaced at runtime via Abstract Factories or Injection through service id qualifiers.

**Correct:**

```java
/**
 * Defines the contract for the user related operations 
 * @see User
 */
 public interface UserService {

 	/**
	 * Persists a user
	 *
	 * @param  user the user to be persisted
	 */
 	void save(User user);

 }

/**
 * Implements the UserService utilizing the Persistence Adapter for storage persistence
 * @see UserService
 */
 @Service
 public class LocalUserServiceImpl implements UserService {

 	/**
	 * A storage independent façade for object persistence
	 */
 	@Autowired
 	private PersistenceAdapter persistenceAdapter;

 	/**
	 * Persists a user
	 *
	 * @param  user the user to be persisted
	 */
 	@Override
 	public void save(User user) {
 		persistenceAdapter.persist(user);
 	}

 }
```

**Incorrect:**

```java
/**
 * Utilizes the Persistence Adapter for storage persistence
 * @see UserService
 */
 @Service
 public class UserService {

 	/**
	 * A storage independent façade for object persistence
	 */
 	@Autowired
 	private PersistenceAdapter persistenceAdapter;

 	/**
	 * Persists a user
	 *
	 * @param  user the user to be persisted
	 */
 	public void save(User user) {
 		persistenceAdapter.persist(user);
 	}

 }
```

## 3. AOP

[Spring AOP](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/reference/aop.html) is extensively used in server side Java based projects at *47 Degrees*.
Developers should be aware that their method classes and method invokations may be decorated, intercepted, validated and that their service runtime instances may be [proxied](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/reference/aop.html#aop-understanding-aop-proxies). This is necessary to implement some of the AOP design patterns that are provided by Spring to such as [Security](http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/docs/3.0.x/apidocs/org/springframework/security/access/annotation/Secured.html), [Transactions](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/transaction.html#transaction-declarative-annotations), Logging, Events, etc.

The [AspectJ Annotation](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.5/reference/aop.html#aop-ataspectj) style is preffered over other AOP flavors.

You can find AOP patterns in use across many layers. 

**Security:**

```java
 	@Override
 	@Secured(SecureRoles.ADMIN) // enforces method access to only admins
 	public void save(User user) {
 		...
 	}
 }
```

**Transactions:**

```java
 	@Override
 	@Transactional // creates, opens and closes a transaction around this method invokation
 	public void save(User user) {
 		...
 	}
 }
```

**Events**

```java
 	@Override
 	@EventListener(Events.ON_USER_SAVE_REQUEST) // notifies this method whenever other service invokes eventService.publish(Events.ON_USER_SAVE_REQUEST, user);
 	public void save(User user) {
 		...
 	}
 }
```

**Logging**

```java
	@Logger //injects the application logger into this service implementation
 	private Log logger;
```

## 4. Spring MVC

Spring MVC is utilized at *47 Degrees* for both building API's and Webapps.
All classes exposed as Web or API controllers should include the [@Controller](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/api/org/springframework/stereotype/Controller.html) annotation and be configured by using the [@RequestMapping](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RequestMapping.html) annotations that determine which paths and variables are mapped to methods.

### 4.1. API's

All API's Services should follow the same pattern described in the [Services](#2-services) section.
Below is an example of an API service implementation that exposes a method at http(s)://host/api/vi1/users/{accessToken}/user/{userId}.

```java
/**
 * Default impl for the UserAPI that maps url requests to methods
 */
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/api/v1/users")
public class UserAPIImpl implements UserAPI {
	
	@Autowired
	private UserService userService;

	/**
	 * Fetches a user by id
	 * This handler maps path variables to method arguments and returns a serialized representation of a UserResponse
	 *
	 * @param  accessToken the requesting user accessToken
	 * @param  userId the id for the user being fetched
	 */
	@Override
	@RequestMapping(value = "/{accessToken:.+}/user/{userId}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
	public @ResponseBody UserResponse getAuthenticatedProfile(@PathVariable("accessToken") String accessToken, @PathVariable("userId") String userId) {
		User requester = userService.getAccountForToken(accessToken);
		User foundUser = userService.getUser(requester, userId);
		return new UserResponse(foundUser);
	}
}
```

### 4.2. Webapps

Webapps controllers do not require to extend from a service interface as they are tightly coupled to the views they handle.
Below is an example of an Web page implementation with its corresponding view

**Controller**

```java
/**
 * User page
 */
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/users")
public class UserAPIImpl implements UserAPI {
	
	@Autowired
	private UserService userService;

	/**
	 * Fetches a user by id
	 * This handler maps path variables to method arguments and dispatch to the appropiate view setting the user model variable used to render the page
	 *
	 * @param  accessToken the requesting user accessToken
	 * @param  userId the id for the user being fetched
	 */
	@Override
	@RequestMapping(value = "/{userId}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
	public ModelAndView getAuthenticatedProfile(ModelAndView mav, @PathVariable("userId") String userId) {
		mav.setViewName("users");
		User foundUser = userService.getUser(userId);
		UserResponse userResponse = new UserResponse(foundUser);
		mav.addObject("user", userResponse);
		return mav;
	}
}
```

**View**
